# Resolving Conflicts in a Merge-Like Flow with Jujutsu

You are a reviewer validating a team's conflict resolution workflow in a Jujutsu (jj) repository. The repository represents a small configuration management project. Your job is to verify that conflicts introduced by diverging branches are properly identified, resolved, and recorded — using idiomatic jj commands.

## Repository Setup

The repository lives at `/home/user/config-project`. It already contains the following structure:

- A root commit with a baseline `config.toml` file.
- Two separate commits branching from the root:
  - A commit with bookmark `feature-timeout` that changes the `timeout` value in `config.toml` from `30` to `60`.
  - A commit with bookmark `feature-retries` that changes the same `timeout` field from `30` to `10`, and also changes the `retries` value from `3` to `5`.
- A merge commit created with `jj new feature-timeout feature-retries` which records the conflict between the two branches in `config.toml`.

The initial `config.toml` at the root looks like:

```toml
[server]
host = "localhost"
port = 8080
timeout = 30
retries = 3
log_level = "info"
```

After the merge commit, `config.toml` will contain conflict markers because both branches modified `timeout` differently.

## Your Tasks

### Task 1: Inspect the conflict

Navigate the repository and identify the conflicted commit. Use `jj log` to view the commit graph and find the merge commit. Use `jj resolve --list` to list all conflicted files in the merge commit. Verify that `config.toml` is listed as conflicted.

### Task 2: Understand the conflict

Check out the merge commit so you can inspect it in the working copy. Use `jj show` or `jj diff` to view the conflict details. Read the conflict markers in `config.toml` to understand what both sides are trying to set for the `timeout` field.

### Task 3: Resolve the conflict manually

Create a new working-copy commit on top of the conflicted merge commit using `jj new` targeting the merge commit's change ID. This will materialize the conflict markers in the working copy of the new commit.

Edit `/home/user/config-project/config.toml` to resolve the conflict. The correct resolution is:
- Keep `timeout = 60` (from `feature-timeout`)
- Keep `retries = 5` (from `feature-retries`)
- Keep all other fields unchanged

The resolved `config.toml` must not contain any conflict markers. It should read:

```toml
[server]
host = "localhost"
port = 8080
timeout = 60
retries = 5
log_level = "info"
```

### Task 4: Squash the resolution into the merge commit

Once the conflict is resolved in the working-copy commit, use `jj squash` to move the resolution into the conflicted merge commit. After squashing, the previously conflicted merge commit should no longer be marked as conflicted.

### Task 5: Set a commit description on the resolved merge commit

After squashing, the merge commit will be your working copy (or you may need to navigate to it). Use `jj describe` to set the commit message of the now-resolved merge commit to exactly:

```
Merge feature-timeout and feature-retries: resolve timeout conflict
```

### Task 6: Move the `main` bookmark to the resolved merge commit

The repository has a `main` bookmark currently pointing at the root commit. After resolving the conflict and describing the merge commit, move the `main` bookmark forward to point at the resolved merge commit using `jj bookmark set`.

### Task 7: Verify the final state

Run `jj log` to confirm:
- The merge commit is no longer marked as conflicted.
- The `main` bookmark points at the resolved merge commit.
- The commit graph shows both `feature-timeout` and `feature-retries` as parents of the merge commit.

Run `jj resolve --list -r main` and confirm it outputs nothing (no conflicts remain).

Cat `/home/user/config-project/config.toml` (by checking out `main` or using `jj show`) and confirm the resolved content is correct.

## Notes

- All work must be done inside `/home/user/config-project`.
- Do NOT use `git` commands — use only `jj` commands.
- Do not use interactive merge tools that require a GUI. You may edit files directly or use `jj resolve --tool :ours` / `jj resolve --tool :theirs` where appropriate, but for this task you must manually edit the file to produce the specific merged result described above.
- The `jj squash` command moves changes from the working-copy commit into its parent; this is the idiomatic way to apply a conflict resolution back into a conflicted commit.
