# Track Branches with Sparse Checkout Patterns

You are a platform engineer responsible for maintaining a large monorepo called `platform-mono`. The repository contains multiple services and infrastructure components organized across several top-level directories:

```
platform-mono/
  services/
    auth/
    payments/
    notifications/
  infra/
    terraform/
    kubernetes/
  docs/
  shared/
    libs/
    protos/
```

You primarily work on the `infra` and `shared` components. To keep your working copy lean and avoid noise from unrelated service directories, you want to use sparse checkout so that only the directories relevant to your work are materialized on disk.

Your repository already has some history with commits on several bookmarks (branches). Your task involves setting up sparse checkout, tracking the right remote bookmarks, and verifying the state of the repository.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Set Up Sparse Checkout for Your Work Area

Navigate to the repository at `/home/user/platform-mono`. Configure sparse checkout so that your working copy only contains the following directory trees:

- `infra/`
- `shared/`
- `docs/`

Use `jj sparse set` to define the sparse patterns. After setting up sparse checkout, verify the patterns are active using `jj sparse list`.

### 2. Create and Track a Feature Bookmark

You need to create a new bookmark called `infra/terraform-refactor` that tracks the remote bookmark `origin/infra/terraform-refactor`. This remote bookmark already exists in the repository.

Create the bookmark at the current working-copy parent revision and configure it to track the corresponding remote bookmark:

```
jj bookmark create infra/terraform-refactor --revision @-
jj bookmark track infra/terraform-refactor@origin
```

After this, confirm the bookmark appears in `jj bookmark list` output.

### 3. Fetch and Reconcile Remote State

Fetch updates from the remote to ensure you have the latest state of all tracked bookmarks:

```
jj git fetch
```

After fetching, check `jj bookmark list` to see the current state of all bookmarks and their remote tracking status.

### 4. Update Sparse Patterns to Add a New Service

Your team has informed you that you now also need visibility into the `services/notifications/` directory as it has a dependency on shared protos. Update your sparse checkout patterns to add this directory:

- `infra/`
- `shared/`
- `docs/`
- `services/notifications/`

Use `jj sparse set` again with the updated list of patterns.

### 5. Create a New Commit in the Infra Directory

Create a new empty commit on top of the current working copy parent using `jj new`. Then create a file at `infra/terraform/backend.tf` with the following content:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "platform-tf-state"
    key    = "infra/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}
```

Describe this commit with the message: `infra: add terraform s3 backend configuration`

### 6. Verify the Final State

Verify the following conditions are true:

- `jj sparse list` includes `infra/`, `shared/`, `docs/`, and `services/notifications/`
- `jj bookmark list` shows `infra/terraform-refactor` tracking `infra/terraform-refactor@origin`
- The file `infra/terraform/backend.tf` exists in the working copy with the correct content
- `jj log -r 'description("infra: add terraform s3 backend configuration")'` returns a non-empty result
- `jj status` exits with code 0

## Notes

- Work entirely within `/home/user/platform-mono`
- Do not use `sudo` or modify system files
- All `jj` commands should be run from within the repository directory
- The sparse checkout patterns must use the exact directory names listed above
- Use `jj describe -m "..."` to set commit messages
