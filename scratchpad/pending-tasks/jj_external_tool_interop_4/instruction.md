You are a platform engineer maintaining a monorepo stack. We need to prepare our jj repository for interoperability with an external code-analysis tool that requires a specific branch structure and metadata format.

1. Initialize a jj repository in `/home/user/monorepo`.
2. Create a base commit with a file `tools_config.json` containing `{"enabled": true}`.
3. Create a bookmark named `tool-integration-base` pointing to this commit.
4. Create two concurrent changes on top of `tool-integration-base`:
   - One modifying `tools_config.json` to add `"timeout": 30` (in a new commit bookmarked `tool-update-timeout`).
   - One adding a new file `linter_rules.yaml` with `rules: strict` (in a new commit bookmarked `tool-add-linter`).
5. Merge these two commits into a single commit (a multi-parent commit) and bookmark it as `tool-integration-ready`.
6. Export the jj operation log to a file `/home/user/monorepo/jj_op_log_export.txt` using a template that shows the operation id and description (`jj op log -T 'id.short() ++ " " ++ description ++ "\n"'`).
