You are a support engineer assisting a developer who has made a "messy" commit containing multiple logical changes and has some uncommitted work in progress. Your goal is to clean up the history by splitting the messy commit and incorporating the uncommitted changes into the appropriate place.

The repository is located at `/home/user/workspace/messy_project`.

The current history contains:
1.  A commit with the description `wip: all the things`. This commit accidentally bundles three distinct changes:
    *   A new feature in `src/logger.py`.
    *   A bug fix in `src/main.py`.
    *   An update to `README.md`.
2.  Uncommitted changes in the working copy (revision `@`) which add a missing import to `src/logger.py`.

Your objective is to rewrite the history to produce three clean, atomic commits with the following requirements:
1.  **Commit 1**: Description `feat: add logger`. This must contain the creation of `src/logger.py` *and* the missing import from the working copy.
2.  **Commit 2**: Description `fix: crash in main`. This must contain the fix in `src/main.py`.
3.  **Commit 3**: Description `docs: update readme`. This must contain the update to `README.md`.

The commits should form a linear history on top of the initial commit. The order of these three commits does not matter, provided they are atomic. The working copy should be clean (empty) after the operation.

Use `jj` commands (`split`, `squash`, `describe`, etc.) to achieve this. Do not use `git` commands.
