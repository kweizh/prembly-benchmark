You are a build engineer working in a jj repository at `/home/user/repo`. Your CI pipeline needs to export build metadata from the current commit (`@`) in JSON format, as well as diff statistics. You will use `jj log` templates and `jj diff` to extract this information.

## Repository State

The repository at `/home/user/repo` has several commits. The working copy (`@`) is a non-empty commit at the top of the stack with the description `feat: add build pipeline`. There is a `main` bookmark several commits below the current position.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Extract Commit Metadata Using Templates

Use `jj log -r '@'` with the `--no-graph` flag and custom templates to extract the following fields from the current working copy commit:

- `commit_id`: the full commit hash (use `commit_id`)
- `change_id`: the full change ID (use `change_id`)
- `author`: the author name (use `author.name()`)
- `email`: the author email (use `author.email()`)
- `timestamp`: the committer timestamp formatted as ISO 8601 (use `committer.timestamp().format("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")`)
- `description`: the commit description (strip trailing newline)
- `parents`: list of parent change IDs as an array (use `parents.map(|p| p.change_id().short(12)).join(",")` and split into a list)

Note: The working copy commit `@` may be empty. If it is, use the parent commit instead: `-r '@-'` for the actual build commit.

### Step 2: Write `/home/user/ci_metadata.json`

Write valid JSON to `/home/user/ci_metadata.json` with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "commit_id": "<full-commit-hash>",
  "change_id": "<full-change-id>",
  "author": "<author-name>",
  "email": "<author-email>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO-timestamp>",
  "description": "<commit-description>",
  "parents": ["<parent-change-id-1>", ...]
}
```

Use real values extracted from `jj log`. The JSON must be valid (parseable by Python's `json.loads()`).

### Step 3: Write `/home/user/ci_diff_stats.txt`

Run `jj diff --stat -r '@-'` (or the relevant build commit) and write the output to `/home/user/ci_diff_stats.txt`.

The file should contain the diff statistics showing which files changed and how many insertions/deletions.

### Step 4: Create Bookmark

Create a bookmark named `ci-metadata-exported` pointing to `'heads(main..@)'`:

`jj bookmark create ci-metadata-exported -r 'heads(main..@)'`

## Important Notes

- Use `jj log --no-graph -r '@-' -T 'commit_id'` (without newline) to get just the commit ID
- Build your JSON by running separate `jj log` commands for each field and assembling in a script
- The `parents` field in JSON should be a JSON array of strings
- Ensure no trailing newlines or extra whitespace in JSON string values

## Acceptance Criteria

- `/home/user/ci_metadata.json` exists and is valid JSON
- JSON has all 7 required fields: `commit_id`, `change_id`, `author`, `email`, `timestamp`, `description`, `parents`
- `commit_id` value is a non-empty hex string
- `change_id` value is a non-empty string
- `parents` is a JSON array with at least one element
- `/home/user/ci_diff_stats.txt` exists and is non-empty
- Bookmark `ci-metadata-exported` exists
