You are a contributor working in a jj repository at `/home/user/repo`. You have a 4-commit patch series on a `feature` branch above `main`. You need to format these commits as email patches for submission to a project mailing list.

## Repository State

The repository at `/home/user/repo` has 4 commits above `main` on the `feature` bookmark:
1. (oldest) `feat: implement config parser` - parses TOML configuration files
2. `feat: add validation layer` - validates parsed config values
3. `feat: implement CLI interface` - command-line argument handling
4. (newest) `feat: add error reporting` - structured error messages

The `feature` bookmark points to commit 4 (the newest).

## Your Task

### Step 1: Inspect the Patch Series

Use `jj log --no-graph -r 'main..feature' --reversed` with appropriate templates to list the commits in order from oldest to newest. You need:
- The commit number (1 through 4)
- The author name and email
- The commit timestamp
- The description (subject line)
- The diff for each commit

### Step 2: Generate Patch Files

Create the directory `/home/user/patches/` and write patch files for each commit.

Each patch file (`0001.patch` through `0004.patch`) must follow RFC 2822-style format:

```
From: Author Name <author@example.com>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0000
Subject: [PATCH N/4] commit description here

Detailed description body if available, otherwise empty.

---
<diff output>
```

Requirements:
- Use `jj log -r REVSET -T 'author.name() ++ " <" ++ author.email() ++ ">"'` to get author info
- Use `jj log -r REVSET -T 'committer.timestamp().format("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S +0000")'` for date
- Use `jj diff -r REVSET` for the diff section
- Files named: `0001.patch`, `0002.patch`, `0003.patch`, `0004.patch`
- `N` in `[PATCH N/4]` is the 1-based index (oldest = 1, newest = 4)
- The `---` separator must be present before the diff

### Step 3: Write Cover Letter

Write `/home/user/patches/0000-cover-letter.patch` with this format:

```
From: Test User <test@example.com>
Date: <date of newest commit>
Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Config parser library implementation

This series implements a configuration parser library with:
- TOML config parsing
- Input validation
- CLI interface
- Structured error reporting

---
```

### Step 4: Write Patch Bundle Log

Write `/home/user/patch_bundle_log.txt` with exactly 4 lines, one per patch subject:

```
[PATCH 1/4] feat: implement config parser
[PATCH 2/4] feat: add validation layer
[PATCH 3/4] feat: implement CLI interface
[PATCH 4/4] feat: add error reporting
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Directory `/home/user/patches/` exists
- Files `0000-cover-letter.patch`, `0001.patch`, `0002.patch`, `0003.patch`, `0004.patch` all exist
- Each patch file (0001-0004) contains `[PATCH N/4]` in the Subject line
- Each patch file contains `From:` header with author name and email
- Each patch file contains `Date:` header
- Each patch file contains `---` separator
- Cover letter has `Subject: [PATCH 0/4]` line
- `/home/user/patch_bundle_log.txt` has exactly 4 lines with `[PATCH N/4]` format
