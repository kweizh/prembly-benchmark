You are a contributor who uses jj and needs to submit a patch series via email to a project that does not use GitHub or GitLab. The project maintainer accepts patches in `git format-patch` style.

Your repository is at `/home/user/patch-work`. It is a colocated jj+git repository. You have a stack of 5 commits above `main`:

1. `fix: correct off-by-one error in parser` — modifies `src/parser.py`
2. `fix: handle empty input in tokenizer` — modifies `src/tokenizer.py`
3. `refactor: extract validation helper` — creates `src/validation.py`
4. `test: add parser edge case tests` — modifies `tests/test_parser.py`
5. `docs: update parser documentation` — modifies `docs/parser.md`

The `patch-series` bookmark points to the tip (commit 5).

## Your Task

You need to export this 5-commit stack as a proper email patch series.

1. **Create the patches directory**: Create `/home/user/patches/` directory.

2. **Export each patch**: For each commit in the stack (commits 1-5 above `main`), create a patch file at:
   - `/home/user/patches/0001-fix-correct-off-by-one-error-in-parser.patch`
   - `/home/user/patches/0002-fix-handle-empty-input-in-tokenizer.patch`
   - `/home/user/patches/0003-refactor-extract-validation-helper.patch`
   - `/home/user/patches/0004-test-add-parser-edge-case-tests.patch`
   - `/home/user/patches/0005-docs-update-parser-documentation.patch`

   Each patch file must contain:
   - `From <COMMIT_HASH> Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001` header
   - `From: Contributor <contrib@example.com>`
   - `Date: <timestamp>`
   - `Subject: [PATCH N/5] <commit description>`
   - A blank line
   - The commit message body
   - `---`
   - The unified diff (the actual file changes)

   You can use `jj log` with templates and `jj diff` to generate these. Alternatively, since this is a colocated repo, you can use `git format-patch` after `jj git export`.

3. **Create a cover letter**: Write `/home/user/patches/0000-cover-letter.patch` with:
   - `From: Contributor <contrib@example.com>`
   - `Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Parser fixes and documentation update`
   - A blank line
   - `This series fixes two parser bugs, refactors validation logic, adds tests, and updates documentation.`
   - `---`
   - A list of the 5 patches with their subjects

4. **Write a log file**: Write `/home/user/patch_export_log.txt` with 5 lines, one per patch:
   ```
   0001: fix: correct off-by-one error in parser
   0002: fix: handle empty input in tokenizer
   0003: refactor: extract validation helper
   0004: test: add parser edge case tests
   0005: docs: update parser documentation
   ```

## Acceptance Criteria

- `/home/user/patches/` directory must exist with exactly 6 files (0000 through 0005).
- Each patch file (0001-0005) must contain `Subject: [PATCH` and the correct sequence number.
- Each patch file must contain a diff section (lines starting with `+` or `-`).
- The cover letter (0000) must contain `[PATCH 0/5]` in its Subject line.
- `/home/user/patch_export_log.txt` must exist with exactly 5 non-empty lines.
