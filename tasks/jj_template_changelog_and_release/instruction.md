You are a release manager for a project hosted in a jj repository at `/home/user/release-repo`.

The repository has a `v1.0` bookmark at the baseline commit `release: v1.0 baseline`, and the following 6 commits above it (each contributed by different team members via configured author metadata):

1. `feat: new dashboard UI` — by **Alice** (`alice@company.com`) — adds `src/dashboard.py`
2. `fix: correct login redirect` — by **Bob** (`bob@company.com`) — modifies `src/auth.py`
3. `feat: add CSV export` — by **Alice** (`alice@company.com`) — adds `src/export.py`
4. `fix: prevent XSS in user input` — by **Charlie** (`charlie@company.com`) — modifies `src/input_sanitizer.py`
5. `chore: update dependencies` — by **Bob** (`bob@company.com`) — modifies `requirements.txt`
6. `feat: add dark mode` — by **Charlie** (`charlie@company.com`) — adds `src/theme.py`

The `main` bookmark points to commit 6 (`feat: add dark mode`).

## Your Task

Prepare the v1.1 release by generating a changelog and tagging the release.

### Step 1: Generate `/home/user/CHANGELOG.md`

Using `jj log` with the revset `v1.0..main`, generate a changelog grouped by commit type. The file must contain **exactly** the following content (entries within each group are sorted alphabetically by subject):

```
## Features
- add CSV export (Alice)
- add dark mode (Charlie)
- new dashboard UI (Alice)

## Bug Fixes
- correct login redirect (Bob)
- prevent XSS in user input (Charlie)

## Maintenance
- update dependencies (Bob)
```

### Step 2: Generate `/home/user/contributor_stats.txt`

Produce a contributor stats file listing each contributor and their commit count (sorted alphabetically by name):

```
Alice: 2
Bob: 2
Charlie: 2
```

### Step 3: Create the release commit

1. Copy `/home/user/CHANGELOG.md` into the repository root as `CHANGELOG.md` and create a new commit with the description `release: v1.1 changelog`.
2. Create a `v1.1` bookmark pointing to this new release commit.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `/home/user/CHANGELOG.md` must exist with the exact content shown above (including blank lines between sections).
- `/home/user/contributor_stats.txt` must exist with exactly 3 lines.
- A commit with description `release: v1.1 changelog` must exist in the repository.
- `CHANGELOG.md` must be present in the repository at the `release: v1.1 changelog` commit.
- The `v1.1` bookmark must point to the `release: v1.1 changelog` commit.
